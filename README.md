## Introduction

Welcome to our final project focusing on the analysis and forecasting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, temperature changes, and renewable energy correlations. We leverage advanced machine learning (ML) methodologies, including Open AI models and Agents, alongside a range of technologies to tackle this pressing environmental challenge.

## Features

- **Open AI Model and Agents:** Implement OpenAI-based model to analyze textual data related to climate and energy.
- **Time Series Forecasting:** Use Prophet and other techniques for accurate forecasting of GHG emissions and temperature variations.
- **Data Visualization:** Utilize Tableau for interactive visualizations showcasing GHG trends and correlations with temperature and renewable energy.
- **Gradio Application:** Develop a Gradio app to enable users to interact with our chatbot and PDF reader, exploring relationships between GHG emissions, temperature changes, and renewable energy adoption.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
